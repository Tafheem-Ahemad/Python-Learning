    "# Module: Iterators, Generators, and Decorators Assignments\n",
    "## Lesson: Iterators, Generators, and Decorators\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Custom Iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a custom iterator class named `Countdown` that takes a number and counts down to zero. Implement the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. Test the iterator by using it in a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Custom Iterable Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `MyRange` that mimics the behavior of the built-in `range` function. Implement the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. Test the class by using it in a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Generator Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a generator function named `fibonacci` that yields the Fibonacci sequence. Test the generator by iterating over it and printing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Generator Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a generator expression that generates the squares of numbers from 1 to 10. Iterate over the generator and print each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Chaining Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two generator functions: `even_numbers` that yields even numbers up to a limit, and `squares` that yields the square of each number from another generator. Chain these generators to produce the squares of even numbers up to 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Simple Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a decorator named `time_it` that measures the execution time of a function. Apply this decorator to a function that calculates the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 7: Decorator with Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a decorator named `repeat` that takes an argument `n` and repeats the execution of the decorated function `n` times. Apply this decorator to a function that prints a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Nested Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two decorators: `uppercase` that converts the result of a function to uppercase, and `exclaim` that adds an exclamation mark to the result of a function. Apply both decorators to a function that returns a greeting message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Class Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class decorator named `singleton` that ensures a class has only one instance. Apply this decorator to a class named `DatabaseConnection` and test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Iterator Protocol with Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a custom iterator class named `ReverseString` that iterates over a string in reverse. Write a decorator named `uppercase` that converts the string to uppercase before reversing it. Apply the decorator to the `ReverseString` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 11: Stateful Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a stateful generator function named `counter` that takes a start value and increments it by 1 each time it is called. Test the generator by iterating over it and printing the first 10 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Generator with Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a generator function named `safe_divide` that takes a list of numbers and yields the division of each number by a given divisor. Implement exception handling within the generator to handle division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Context Manager Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a decorator named `open_file` that manages the opening and closing of a file. Apply this decorator to a function that writes some text to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: Infinite Iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an infinite iterator class named `InfiniteCounter` that starts from a given number and increments by 1 indefinitely. Test the iterator by printing the first 10 values generated by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 15: Generator Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Write three generator functions: `integers` that yields integers from 1 to 10, `doubles` that yields each integer doubled, and `negatives` that yields the negative of each doubled value. Chain these generators to create a pipeline that produces the negative doubled values of integers from 1 to 10."
